Assignment: 02

This program uses and tests the Deque class. Elements can be added/deleted to this linked list from both ends.

To run:
1. Type 'make'
2. User will be prompted to enter 3 integer numbers to the front of the deque.
3. User once again will be prompted for 3 numbers to allocate them at the back of the deque.

OR:
1. Type 'make test' to test the program with predetermined input from 'testfile.txt'.
2. Program will create 'output.txt' and compare it with 'xpected_output.txt'.
3. If both files are the same it means the program runs succesfully.
4. To view the resulting output open 'output.txt'.

Expected output:
1. Program will print size, front, and back of deque.
2. Program will pop an element from front and print the updated front of deque.
3. Program will pop an element from back and then print the updated back of the deque.
4. Program will print updated size of the deque(smaller).
5. Program will test the overloaded assignment by assigning origianl deque to deque 2.
6. Program will test copy constructor and should print the front of the newly created deque similar to the front of original deque.
7. Finally, two deconstructors will be called because there are two objects.
